Black carbon emissions in particular is contributing to pollution and melting of the Himalayan glacier which supplies drinking water for 1.5 billion South Asians.
    Our technology saves 40-60% of CO2 emissions per house. For a 3 room house this equals 4.58 ton of CO2 emissions compared to using fired bricks. (a flight between London-Kathmandu-London emits approx. 2.8 ton CO2. Numbers are based on research by Auroville Earth Institute in India and ICIMOD Nepal.`,
