        We have 288 active enterprises/ communities building with CSEB. You can
        see the details of each enterprise on the map below including a
        breakdown of how many houses they have built, jobs created and Co2
        saved. On average each enterprise builds 10-20 houses per year and
        creates 8-10 jobs. The data is collected from our enterprises and is
        based on their reports.

        Each enterprise / community reports on regular basis how many bricks
        they have sold and how many houses/building have been built. If they
        donâ€™t know exactly how many houses were built (other people bought their
        bricks and built on their own) We calculate average 3500 bricks per
        house (standard for a 4-room house) We do our best to validate the data
        by regular field visits. Each house built means on average 25% savings
        for the family compared to using traditional materials.

        1885 jobs in construction of houses. Each enterprise reports how many

        man-days = one job for a year.

        melting of the Himalayan glacier which supplies drinking water for 1.5
        billion South Asians. Our technology saves 40-60% of CO2 emissions per
        house. For a 3 room house this equals 9.5 ton of CO2 emissions compared
        to using fired bricks. (a flight between London-Kathmandu-London emits
        approx. 2.8 ton CO2. Numbers are based on research by{" "}
