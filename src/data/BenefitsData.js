          CSEB bricks are produced by local materials, and cost less than fired
          bricks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transportation is reduced as bricks are produced locally</li>
          <li>
            Less mortar - as the mortar is poured through the holes in the
            bricks
          </li>
          <li>
            Less manpower as the LEGO shape of the bricks makes it fast and easy
            to build
          </li>
          <li>Plaster is not needed â€“ you can paint directly on the bricks </li>

            A CSEB wall of 150 mm thickness is as strong as a fired brick wall
            of 230 mm reducing the overall material required in the wall.{" "}
